# Short--term-Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-using-Deep-Learning
Deep learning–based short-term electricity demand forecasting using LSTM, RNN with renewable energy and weather inputs.
This project builds a deep learning model for short-term electricity demand forecasting using LSTM, RNN, architectures. 
It combines historical load data with solar/wind generation and weather parameters to capture temporal patterns for accurate predictions. 
The workflow includes data normalization, sequence generation, and train-test splitting to ensure reliable model performance.
